JavaScript Object Manipulation Assignment
This project processes a list of sculpture objects and creates a new object with the length of each string value in the original objects.
Output Example
The first object in the sculptureListLengths array looks like this:
javascript{
  name: 26,
  artist: 20,
  description: 198,
  url: 31,
  alt: 90
}
Complete sculptureListLengths Array
The complete output of the sculptureListLengths array will appear here when the script is run, displaying the length of each string property for all sculptures in the original list.
